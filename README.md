### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my ✨ _special_ ✨ repo.
I know what this is. I just think you're probably looking [FOR MY SITE instead](https://rgoswami.me) or [my CV](https://github.com/HaoZeke/CV/blob/master/RG_Latest-cv.pdf).

Have some quotes:

> “I write this diary reluctantly. Its dishonest honesty wearies me. For whom am I writing? If I am writing for myself, then why is it being published? If for the reader, why do I pretend that I am talking to myself? Are you talking to yourself so that others will hear you?” --- _Diary by Witold Gombrowicz_

> “Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!” --- _Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson_

Other things I can't recall.

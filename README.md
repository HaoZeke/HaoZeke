Have some quotes:

**For life**

> “I write this diary reluctantly. Its dishonest honesty wearies me. For whom am I writing? If I am writing for myself, then why is it being published? If for the reader, why do I pretend that I am talking to myself? Are you talking to yourself so that others will hear you?” --- _Diary by Witold Gombrowicz_

> “Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!” --- _Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson_

> “Happy families are all alike; every
>unhappy family is unhappy in its own
>way.” --- _Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy_

> “Our lives are rivers, gliding free to
> that unfathomed, boundless sea, the
> silent grave!“ --- _Jorge Manrique_

**For work**

>	"Dealing with failure is easy: Work hard to improve.
> Success is also easy to handle: You've solved the wrong problem.
> Work hard to improve." --– _Alan Perlis_

> "If you want to have good ideas,
>  you must have many ideas." –-- _Linus Pauling_

> “Running a few MO calculations doesn't make
> one an electronic structure theorist any more
> than sleeping in one's garage makes him/her an
> automobile.“ --- _Quantum Chemistry by Henry F. Schaefer III_

> “The derivation can be made to look slightly
> less juvenile by introducing an obscure
> notation at this point“ --- _P. Pechukas, in Dynamics of
Molecular Collisions, Part B_

Other things I can't recall.
